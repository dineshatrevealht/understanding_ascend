### Q1: Client Entity
Could you please clarify what the **Client** entity is intended to represent in our system?  
I noticed the note *"Model for storing user-defined Clients"*, but I’d appreciate a bit more context on how it’s expected to be used functionally.

### Q2: File Relationship with Project and Client
For file uploads, are **Project** and **Client** required associations, or can files exist independently?

### Q3: DocumentGroup & EnrichedIndex Usage
How are we planning to use **DocumentGroup** and **EnrichedIndex** within the system?  
I’d love to better understand the intended workflow or purpose behind these.
